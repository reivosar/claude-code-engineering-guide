# DSL Loading Order and Dependency Analysis

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the DSL system, I've identified several **critical dependency issues** that could cause system failures:

1. **CRITICAL: Forward References**: Components referenced before they're loaded
2. **HIGH: Conditional Loading Gaps**: Unclear trigger conditions for critical files
3. **RESOLVED: File Existence**: All referenced files exist and are properly structured

## Loading Sequence Analysis

### 1. Entry Point (entry-point.dsl)

**Loading Order**: First
**Defines**:
- `variables.*` (validation_passed, behaviors_list, checklist_questions, mandatory_rules_list)
- `components.*` (behaviors, task_types, checklist_basic, mandatory_rules)
- `rules`
- `flow`

**References**:
- ✅ `${variables.behaviors_list}` - OK, defined above
- ✅ `${variables.checklist_questions}` - OK, defined above
- ✅ `${variables.mandatory_rules_list}` - OK, defined above
- ✅ `${components.behaviors}` - OK, defined above
- ✅ `${components.task_types}` - OK, defined above
- ⚠️ `components.validation_execution` - NOT YET LOADED (defined in development.dsl)
- ⚠️ `components.validation_principles` - NOT YET LOADED (defined in development.dsl)
- ✅ `components.checklist_basic` - OK, defined above

### 2. Development DSL (development.dsl) - Conditionally Loaded

**Loading Order**: Second (only if task_type == "development")
**Defines**:
- `variables.*` (validation_order, execution_steps, required_artifacts_list, completion_criteria_list)
- `components.*` (validation_principles, validation_execution, security_verification_process, completion_requirements, development_checklist, commit_rule)

**References**:
- ✅ `${variables.validation_order}` - OK, defined above
- ✅ `${variables.execution_steps}` - OK, defined above
- ✅ `${variables.required_artifacts_list}` - OK, defined above
- ✅ `${variables.completion_criteria_list}` - OK, defined above
- ⚠️ `components.development_checklist` - Referenced before external files might define it

**External Loads**:
1. `behavior-rules/index.dsl` (unconditional)
2. `validation-rules/index.dsl` (via load_on_execution in validation_execution)
3. `security-rules/index.dsl` (via load_external_rules in security_verification_process)
4. Conditional loads based on various conditions

### 3. Behavior Rules (behavior-rules/index.dsl)

**Loading Order**: Third (when development.dsl loads)
**Loads**:
- `behavior-rules/communication-behavior.dsl`
- `behavior-rules/work-process-behavior.dsl`
- `behavior-rules/task-classification-behavior.dsl`
- `behavior-rules/failure-recovery-behavior.dsl`
- `behavior-rules/unexpected-situation-behavior.dsl`
- `behavior-rules/debugging-analysis-behavior.dsl`

**Issue**: These files define behaviors but don't seem to be referenced by the main flow

### 4. Conditionally Loaded Files

These files are loaded based on conditions that might never be true:

- `risk-assessment.dsl` - Loaded if `requires_risk_assessment`
- `app-types.dsl` - Loaded if `requires_app_type_detection`
- `coding-rules/index.dsl` - Loaded if `requires_code_quality`
- `design-rules/index.dsl` - Loaded if `has_ui_components`
- `git-rules/index.dsl` - Loaded if `requires_git_operations`

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Forward Reference Problem in entry-point.dsl

```yaml
rules:
  - if: task_type == "development"
    then:
      include:
        - components.validation_execution  # NOT YET LOADED!
        - components.validation_principles # NOT YET LOADED!
```

These components are referenced in rules (line 46-47) but aren't loaded until development.dsl is loaded later in the flow (line 79).

### 2. Conditional Loading Gaps

The system relies on conditions that aren't clearly defined:
- Where is `requires_risk_assessment` set?
- Where is `requires_app_type_detection` set?
- Where is `has_ui_components` set?

If these conditions aren't properly set, critical files won't load.

### 3. Missing File References

Several files reference others that may not exist:
- `validation-rules/correctness-verification.dsl` references `coding-rules/testing-strategy.dsl`
- Various index files load sub-files that need verification

### 4. Circular Dependency Risk

- `entry-point.dsl` references components from `development.dsl`
- `development.dsl` might need variables from `entry-point.dsl`
- External files might reference components not yet loaded

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Required

1. **CRITICAL: Fix Forward Reference Bug**
   - **Problem**: Rules reference components before they're loaded
   - **Solution**: Move the rules evaluation to AFTER development.dsl is loaded
   - **Implementation**: Either move rules into development.dsl or restructure the flow

2. **HIGH: Define Conditional Loading Triggers**
   - **Problem**: Conditions like `requires_code_quality` are never set
   - **Solution**: Add explicit condition setting in the flow
   - **Implementation**: Add condition evaluation steps before conditional loads

### Detailed Fix Plan

#### Option 1: Move Rules to development.dsl (Recommended)
```yaml
# In entry-point.dsl - REMOVE the problematic rules section
# Move these lines to development.dsl:
rules:
  - if: task_type == "development"
    then:
      include:
        - components.validation_execution
        - components.validation_principles
```

#### Option 2: Restructure Flow (Alternative)
```yaml
# In entry-point.dsl flow section:
- if: task_type == "development"
  then:
    - action: load_dsl
      target: "development.dsl"
    - action: evaluate_rules  # Move rules evaluation here
    - action: develop
```

#### Option 3: Eager Loading (Simple but less efficient)
```yaml
# In entry-point.dsl - always load development components
flow:
  - action: load_dsl
    target: "development.dsl"
  # Then the rest of the flow...
```

### Conditional Loading Fixes

Add explicit condition setting:
```yaml
# In development.dsl flow:
- action: detect_requirements
  set_conditions:
    requires_code_quality: "check_for_source_files"
    has_ui_components: "check_for_ui_frameworks"
    requires_git_operations: "check_git_repo"
```

## Critical Execution Flow Analysis

### Scenario: Development Task Execution

1. **entry-point.dsl loads** (variables and components defined)
2. **Flow begins execution**:
   - assign_role with `${components.behaviors}` ✅ (available)
   - classify_task with `${components.task_types}` ✅ (available)
   - Ask/confirm cycle ✅
3. **Rules evaluation** - THIS IS WHERE IT BREAKS:
   ```yaml
   rules:
     - if: task_type == "development"
       then:
         include:
           - components.validation_execution  # ❌ NOT YET LOADED!
           - components.validation_principles # ❌ NOT YET LOADED!
   ```
4. **System attempts to include undefined components** → **SYSTEM FAILURE**
5. **development.dsl loads** (too late - after rules tried to use it)

### The Loading Order Bug

The system evaluates rules BEFORE loading the files that define the referenced components:

**Current Order**:
1. Load entry-point.dsl
2. Evaluate rules (tries to include validation_*)
3. Execute flow (tries to load development.dsl)

**Required Order**:
1. Load entry-point.dsl  
2. Execute flow (load development.dsl first)
3. Evaluate rules (now validation_* are available)

## Broken References Summary

### 1. **CRITICAL: Forward Reference in entry-point.dsl** 
   - **Location**: Lines 45-47
   - **Issue**: References `components.validation_execution` and `components.validation_principles` 
   - **Problem**: These components are defined in development.dsl which isn't loaded until flow execution
   - **Impact**: System failure on any development task

### 2. **HIGH: Conditional Loading Trigger Gaps**
   - **Missing Conditions**: No clear definition of when these conditions are set:
     - `requires_risk_assessment`
     - `requires_app_type_detection` 
     - `requires_code_quality`
     - `has_ui_components`
     - `requires_git_operations`
   - **Impact**: Critical files may never load even when needed

### 3. **RESOLVED: File Existence Verified**
   - ✅ All index.dsl files exist and properly reference their sub-files
   - ✅ All referenced files like `coding-rules/testing-strategy.dsl` exist
   - ✅ File structure is complete and consistent

## System Failure Analysis

**For Development Tasks**: The system will fail because:
1. User classifies task as "development"
2. Rules try to include validation components
3. Components don't exist yet (development.dsl not loaded)
4. System halts with component not found error
5. development.dsl never gets loaded because system failed earlier

**For Non-Development Tasks**: System works fine because:
1. No forward references to missing components
2. Only uses components defined in entry-point.dsl
3. Flow executes normally
