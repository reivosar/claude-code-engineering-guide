# Testing Requirements

## Risk-Stratified Coverage

| Risk Level            | Line Coverage | Branch Coverage | Mutation Testing | Test Types               | Performance           |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| R0 (Mission-Critical) | 100%          | 100%            | 95%              | Unit + Integration + E2E + Performance + Security + Accessibility | Load testing required |
| R1 (Important)        | 95%           | 90%             | 90%              | Unit + Integration + Performance | Basic benchmarks      |
| R2 (Experimental)     | 90%           | 85%             | 80%              | Unit + Happy path        | Manual validation     |

## Differential Coverage Rules

### Legacy Code Integration

- Coverage/Mutation thresholds apply **to changed lines only**
- Existing untested code doesn't block new feature delivery
- Gradual improvement strategy over time

### Hotfix Process

- Critical production fixes can bypass full coverage
- Requires post-fix cleanup and test addition
- Maximum 48-hour window for coverage completion

## Test Pyramid Strategy

### Unit Tests (70% of total tests)
- **Fast execution**: Should run quickly for rapid feedback
- **Isolated components**: Test individual units in isolation
- **Mock external dependencies**: Use mocks/stubs for external services
- **Requirements**:
  - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
  - Test error conditions and exception handling
  - Test happy path scenarios

### Integration Tests (20% of total tests)
- **Test component interactions**: Verify how components work together
- **Use real dependencies when possible**: Test with actual services where feasible
- **Verify data flow**: Ensure data moves correctly between components

### End-to-End Tests (10% of total tests)
- **Test critical user journeys**: Focus on most important user workflows
- **Verify end-to-end functionality**: Test complete business processes
- **Run in production-like environment**: Use realistic test environments

## Performance Testing Standards

### R0 Requirements

- Load testing with realistic traffic patterns
- Stress testing at 2x expected peak load
- Endurance testing for 24+ hours
- Performance regression testing in CI

### R1 Requirements

- Basic load testing with expected traffic
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Regression detection for major changes

### R2 Requirements

- Manual performance validation
- Basic monitoring and alerting setup

## Test Quality Standards

### Test Quality Principles
- **Tests should be deterministic**: Same input = same output, every time
- **Tests should be independent**: No dependencies between test cases
- **Tests should be readable**: Clear test intent and assertions
- **Tests should be maintainable**: Easy to update when requirements change

### Test Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Avoid testing implementation details**: Focus on behavior, not internal structure
- **Avoid brittle selectors**: Use stable, semantic selectors in UI tests
- **Avoid shared test state**: Each test should set up its own data
- **Avoid slow tests without reason**: Optimize test performance where possible

### Coverage Enforcement
- **Coverage must meet targets before merge**
- **New code must not decrease overall coverage**
- **Mutation testing required for critical paths**
- **Differential coverage**: Thresholds apply to changed lines only when touching legacy code

### Test Quality Gates

#### Before Commit
- All tests passing at appropriate risk level
- No flaky tests (>95% pass rate over 10 runs)
- Performance tests within acceptable thresholds
- Coverage targets met for risk level

#### Mutation Testing
- Focus on critical business logic
- Exclude trivial getters/setters
- Target complex conditional logic and algorithms
- Meet mutation score targets by risk level

## Test Organization & Naming

### File and Class Naming
- **Test files**: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
- **Test classes**: `ClassNameTest`
- **Test methods**: `should_behave_when_condition`

### Test Structure (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- **Arrange**: Set up test data and mocks
- **Act**: Execute the behavior under test
- **Assert**: Verify expected outcomes

### Mock Strategy
- **Mock external dependencies**: APIs, databases, third-party services
- **Avoid mocking internal domain logic**: Keep business logic tests realistic
- **Use test doubles for slow or unreliable resources**: File systems, network calls

### Accessibility Testing
- **Automated accessibility scans**: Include in CI pipeline
- **Manual keyboard testing**: Verify keyboard navigation
- **Screen reader testing**: Test with assistive technologies
- **Color contrast validation**: Ensure WCAG compliance

### Security Testing
- **XSS vulnerability testing**: For web applications
- **SQL injection testing**: For API services
- **Command injection testing**: For CLI applications
- **Authentication bypass testing**: For protected resources
