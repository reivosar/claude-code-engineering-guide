# When Stuck (What Smart Engineers Do)

1. **Step back and rubber duck**: Explain the problem to someone (or yourself)
2. **Check documentation thoroughly**: Docs, source code, commit history, architecture decisions
3. **Simplify ruthlessly**: Remove complexity until the problem becomes obvious
4. **Ask better questions**: Instead of "how do I fix this?" ask "why does this exist?"
5. **Spike and throw away**: Build a quick prototype to understand the problem space
6. **Talk to humans**: Senior engineers know when to ask for help early
7. **Validate before asking**: Ensure code compiles, tests pass, and basic functionality works before seeking input
